# GitHub Copilot C++ Quick Commands & Features Cheatsheet

**1. GitHub Copilot Chat (Main Panel)**

* **Access:** Open via VS Code Activity Bar or Command Palette.
* **Key Participants (`@` prefix - Rule: Max ONE per prompt):**
    * `@workspace`: Context of your entire open project/folder. Essential for most project-aware tasks.
    * `@vscode`: Context of your VS Code editor settings and state. For editor-related questions.
    * `@terminal`: Context from the integrated terminal (last command, selection).
* **Key Context Variables (`#` prefix):**
    * `#file:PATH/TO/FILE.cpp` (or `#file` & select): Specific file(s). *Tip: Drag files/folders into Chat.*
    * `#selection`: Currently selected code in the active editor.
    * `#symbol:MyClass::myMethod` (or `#symbol` & select): A specific C++ symbol.
* **Common Slash Commands:**
    * `/explain` (e.g., `#selection /explain`): Explains code or concepts.
    * `/fix` (e.g., `#selection /fix this bug`): Proposes fixes for code or errors.
    * `/tests` (e.g., `@workspace #file:src/utils.cpp /tests`): Generates unit tests.
    * `/doc` (e.g., `#selection /doc`): Generates documentation comments (e.g., Doxygen).
    * `/clear`: Clears the current chat session.
* **Interacting with Chat Responses:**
    * Insert into active editor, copy code, run in terminal (for commands).
    * Use "Edits Mode" (pencil icon on suggestion or `Cmd+E`/`Ctrl+E`) for direct application of changes or to populate manually created empty files.

**2. Inline Chat (In-Editor)**

* **Access:** `Cmd+I` (macOS) or `Ctrl+I` (Windows/Linux) with code selected or cursor in place.
* **Usage:** Quick explanations, refactoring, documentation, or small code generations directly within the editor context.
* **Slash Commands:** `/explain`, `/fix`, `/doc` work here effectively on the surrounding or selected code.
* **Review Suggestions:** Cycle through multiple suggestions if offered (e.g., `Alt+]` or `Option+]`).

**3. Code Completions (As You Type)**

* **Automatic Suggestions:** Receive real-time C++ code suggestions while typing.
* **Trigger:** Appears automatically; can also be manually invoked (e.g., `Ctrl+Space`).
* **Interaction:** `Tab` to accept, `Esc` to dismiss. Review multi-line suggestions.

**4. Guiding & Customizing Copilot**

* **Workspace Instructions (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`):**
    * **What:** Project-wide, persistent, high-level guidance (e.g., C++17, CMake, overall architecture, general coding style).
* **Custom Instructions (via `.vscode/settings.json` linking `.md` files):**
    * **What:** Detailed, specific rules for tasks like code generation (e.g., `docs/instructions/codegen_cpp.md`) or test generation (`docs/instructions/testgen_cpp.md`).
    * **How:** Reference your `.md` instruction files in VS Code's workspace `settings.json` (check current Copilot docs for exact setting keys like `github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions`).
* **Feature Specifications (User-created `.md` in `docs/features/`):**
    * **What:** Your detailed written requirements for a feature *before* coding.
    * **How:** Reference this spec file in prompts (e.g., `@workspace #file:docs/features/my_feature.md Implement this...`).
* **"Agent" Workflows (User-created `.md` in `docs/workflows/`):**
    * **What:** Your custom multi-step instructions for Copilot to follow for complex tasks (e.g., implementing a feature from spec).
    * **How:** Reference workflow file in Chat, providing specific inputs like the feature spec path.
* **Reusable Prompts (`.prompts/*.prompt.md`):**
    * **What:** Your library of parameterized prompts for common, smaller C++ tasks.
    * **How:** Invoke via `# (select .prompts/my_prompt.md)` in Chat.

**Important Reminders:**

* **File Creation:** Manually create new folders and empty `.h`/`.cpp` files. Then, use Copilot Chat (Edits Mode is great for this) to populate these files.
* **Review All Suggestions:** Always critically review and test code generated by Copilot.
